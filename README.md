Thank you for downloading LegendCraft, a custom Minecraft/ClassiCube server based on fCraft and 800craft.

Special thanks to fragmer, for creating fCraft! Special thanks to Jonty800, GlennMR and LaoTszy for their hard 

work with
800Craft! LegendCraft is a modified version of 800Craft. 


##Installation 
####(Windows) 

LegendCraft requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0. Your system may already have it
installed, and you can download it from  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851
Plugins not working? Getting plugin errors?
Go to your plugins folder and right click on all the plugin.dll's. Select unblock for all of them.

####(Linux, Unix, MacOS X)

LegendCraft requires Mono 2.10 (recommended). You can
download it from www.mono-project.org, or (on some Linux distributions) install
it through your package manager.

To be able to use graphical LegendCraft components (ServerGUI and ConfigGUI) you
will also need GDI+ library (libgdiplus). Before starting LegendCraft, make sure
that it has read/write permissions in the LegendCraft directory.

To run ".exe" files with Mono, use the following syntax:
Mono 2.6.4: "mono SomeFile.exe"
Mono 2.8+:  "mono --gc=sgen SomeFile.exe"

If you're intending to run a public server that appears on minecraft.net's server list, 	
you need to import https certificates to tell mono you trust them, this can be done by 
running "sudo mozroots --import --ask-remove" as the LegendCraft user on your system.

You may also have to run "sudo certmgr -ssl -m https://minecraft.net" in order for heartbeats to work 
properly.
